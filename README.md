# Wedding invitation

Just a simple invitation for our wedding.

## Big warning for compatibility

This project is constructed using TypeScript and HTML5 without using any other frameworks/libraries.

Code is only tested on modern browsers and mobile devices (Cuz this is the daily for most of Chinese people).

## How to build & run

Only 3 steps to build.

1. Install dependencies.

```bash
npm i
```

2. Compile typescript source code into javascript.

```bash
npm run build
```

3. Start a temporary http server to preview.

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

## About photos & maintenance

I use 31 slides originally and removed them for privacy reason, you may need to fill these missing parts up or just change the code by yourself.

This is a disposable project just like all other invitations, so this will not receive any kind of updates when finished its mission.

If you gotta any problems or bugs or whatever it is, you may need to Fix It Yourself, sorry about this.
